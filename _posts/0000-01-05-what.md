## What we should do

* Define structures
* Create safety
* Support supporters

---

## 1. Define structures

+ Role descriptions
+ Learning maps
  + e.g. roadmap.sh
+ Discoverable structure helps people who process offline / don’t feel safe asking questions

## People need to track progress

+ Provide ways to do this centrally
+ Otherwise, people will create their own
+ Consider spreadsheets, Slack lists, templated kanban boards, custom app

## 2. Create safety

+ Why is safety critical?

Note: Going on to talk about how we learn

--

## How do you revise?

+ Retrieval strengthens memory
+ Actively recalling information reinforces neural connections
+ Storage alone is insufficient
+ How can this be applied in the workplace?
  + Questioning > explaining
  + Actively coding > observing
  + Flash cards > reading

--

## Where does stress come from?

+ Fear
+ Power dynamics
  + Gender
  + Experience / status
  + Pejorative language
  + Language / cultural barrier
  + Ethnicity
+ Workload / urgency (consider types of work)

--

## Building a culture of feedback

+ Contracting, retrospecting
+ Role modelling by requesting advice
  + ‘What would you change?’
  + ‘What did you learn?’
  + ‘What did you enjoy?’
+ Structured feedback (see [How to make a sandwich—Dan North talking about how to deliver feedback](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8sNSNkWFpc))

--

## Consider delivery styles

+ Personalised learning valuable in 1:1 scenario
+ Learning style theory somewhat discredited
  + Visual, Auditory, Reading/Writing, Kinasthetic
  + Consider things like auditory processing disorder
+ Mixed formats are more engaging, strengthen understanding, avoid disabilities
+ Don’t guess, ask!

---

## 3. Support the supporters

+ Track progress
+ Recognise success

--

## Regular supporter forums

+ Opportunity for mentors and managers to share perspectives and seek support
+ Can be peer based
+ Allows initiatives to scale up and get better
+ Highlights areas with opportunities to improve

--

## Achieving critical mass

+ Recent learners have massive empathy for those at the start of their journey
+ In time the talent pipeline starts to feed back positively
+ Takes over five years to prime the pipeline
+ Creates feeling of progression and opportunities to practice coaching & mentoring
+ Nice stepping stone towards management
+ Speeds progression of this group towards leadership
