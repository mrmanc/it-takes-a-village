## How this can make a tangible difference

+ Entering technology roles without a relevant university degree can be terrifying
+ Huge learning curve early on
+ Learning requires safety
+ Stress prevents learning

--

## Neurological response to stress

+ Stress hormones cause focus on threats rather than exploration and problem solving
  + Less likely to ask questions
+ Cortisol interferes with the forming of new memories and integrating knowledge
+ Brain prioritises error avoidance over experimentation

Note: Activity shifts from prefrontal cortex to the amygdala  
    Cortisol interferes with the hippocampus 

--

## Biases slow progression

+ Well defined success criteria avoid statements like ‘There are still some fundamentals they need to learn’
+ Can measure by monitoring progression against characteristics

--

## Reduced leaks, increased flow

+ Talent pipeline is leakiest with less represented characteristics
+ Consensus around role definitions reduces bias, progression inertia
+ Creating safety allows people to meet their potential
